// slice() = JavaScript is used to take a small part from an array or string without changing the original one.

let students = ["manu", "hari", "abi", 10, 20, 30, 5]

let myStudents = students.slice(0, 4)
console.log(students);

console.log(myStudents);

//example in array from which index  we need the values we can access my calling slice (0, 3);
